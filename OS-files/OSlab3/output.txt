MY INTEREST WAS SPARKED EVEN MORE WHEN AS AN UNDERGRADUATE I WAS ASKED TO ASSIST IN A STUDY ONE OF MY PROFESSORS WAS CONDUCTING ON HOW CHILDREN EXPERIENCE AND PROCESS FEAR AND THE PROSPECT OF DEATH THIS PROFESSOR WAS NOT IN THE MEDICAL FIELD; RATHER HER BACKGROUND IS IN CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY I WAS VERY HONORED TO BE PART OF THIS PROJECT AT SUCH AN EARLY STAGE OF MY CAREER DURING THE STUDY WE DISCOVERED THAT CHILDREN FACE DEATH IN EXTREMELY DIFFERENT WAYS THAN ADULTS DO WE FOUND THAT CHILDREN FACING FATAL ILLNESSES ARE VERY AWARE OF THEIR CONDITION EVEN WHEN IT HASNâ€™T BEEN FULLY EXPLAINED TO THEM AND ON THE WHOLE WERE WILLING TO FIGHT THEIR ILLNESSES BUT WERE ALSO MORE ACCEPTING OF THEIR POTENTIAL FATE THAN MANY ADULTS FACING SIMILAR DIAGNOSES WE CONCLUDED OUR STUDY BY ASKING WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT THIS DISCOVERY SHOULD IMPACT THE TYPE OF CARE GIVEN TO CHILDREN IN CONTRAST TO ADULTS I AM EAGER TO CONTINUE THIS SORT OF RESEARCH AS I PURSUE MY MEDICAL CAREER THE INTERSECTION OF MEDICINE PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIALIZATION OR CULTURE IN THIS CASE THE SOCIAL VARIABLES DIFFERENTIATING ADULTS FROM CHILDREN IS QUITE FASCINATING AND IS A FIELD THAT IS IN NEED OF BETTER RESEARCH

ALTHOUGH MUCH HEADWAY HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS AREA IN THE PAST TWENTY OR SO YEARS I FEEL THERE IS A STILL A TENDENCY IN MEDICINE TO TREAT DISEASES THE SAME WAY NO MATTER WHO THE PATIENT IS WE ARE SLOWLY LEARNING THAT PROCEDURES AND DRUGS ARE NOT ALWAYS UNIVERSALLY EFFECTIVE NOT ONLY MUST WE ALTER OUR CARE OF PATIENTS DEPENDING UPON THESE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS WE MAY ALSO NEED TO ALTER OUR ENTIRE EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THEM AS WELL^
